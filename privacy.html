            Cookies Policy for details), which allows us to maintain the proper functioning of the Games and to analyse
            information about your activity in the Game. We process this data to improve the quality of the services we
            offer and to improve the functioning of the Game. It may also be the case that cookies (or similar files)
            help us tailor the content available through the Game to your interests (profiling). We may use certain
            cookies for marketing purposes, both in the App or on the websites of our business partners.</p>

        <p>In general, the legal basis for the use of cookies and similar technologies is your consent.</p>

        <p>However, the basis for processing data that has been collected using cookie technology is our legitimate
            interest or that of a so-called third party (Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR among other things, the need to
            ensure the highest quality of the content, and sometimes also the marketing of our or our partners' products
            and services, in which case the partners are not involved in the processing of your data. To the extent that
            also our partners may have direct access to this information the legal basis for such processing is your
            freely given consent (Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR).</p>

        <p>We process your Personal Data on the basis of your consent until you withdraw it. Your Personal Data
            processed on the basis of our legitimate interest may be stored until you object to its processing, except
            where, despite your objection, we conclude that there are compelling legitimate grounds for the processing
            overriding your interests, rights and freedoms, or grounds for establishing, exercising or defending claims.
        </p>

        <p>The above does not apply if the use of cookies and similar files is necessary for the correct operation of
            the Game (to provide you with an electronic service), where we rely on the law and, as applicable, the
            necessity of the processing for the performance of the Service Agreement (Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR). Your

            period for Personal Data will apply.</p>

            rights, or freedoms, or grounds for establishing, exercising, or defending claims.</p>
